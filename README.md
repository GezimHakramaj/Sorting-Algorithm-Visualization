# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
I developed this little project since I was fascinated by the magnitude of variety when it came to the approach of each algorithm.
Simple way to visualize sorting algorithms.

Algorithms include{
  Insertion Sort,
  Bubble Sort,
  Quick Sort, 
  Merge Sort,
  Cocktail-Shaker Sort,
  Selection Sort,
  Counting Sort,
  Radix Sort
}
You use the slider in order to change the size of the array (100 - 1000), array values are non-repeating and non-negative.
You may regenerate the array in order to re-randomize without changing the size from the slider.
You may change the speed of the algorithms from slow, normal and fast in real time with any algo.
Pause/Reset function is implemented if you so choose to withdraw sorting for ex Bubble Sort on a size of 1000 array (Its really slow).
