# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization

I developed this little project since I was fascinated by the magnitude of variety when it came to the approach of each algorithm.
Simple way to visualize sorting algorithms.

## Algorithms include:
  - Insertion Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Cocktail-Shaker Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Radix Sort

## Instructions

The buttons from left to right are pretty straight forward! Generate New Array will create a new array for you to play with. Reset and Stop work together, stopping the current sort and resetting to a brand new array. The slider is used for changing the size of the array. The buttons after are for speed to slow down or fasten up the algorithm sorting. The clock display is for you to time how fast the algorithm sorts and compare to others! Next up on the right side are all different algorithms to choose from.

Hope you enjoy and sort away!
